## Intro

President Trump is well known for using Twitter. It is interesting to look inside and see whether there are some correlation between his tweets and the current public health crisis.   
In this project, Trump's tweets data, Covid cases and deaths data in US are analyzed and visualized. More details in jupyter notebook.

## Trump's tweet's data
Tweet data of Trump is from Jan 1 2020 to Oct 1 2020, right before he hits COVID-19. Data source: http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com/archive, I find this website so interesting and amazing. I didn't scrape from twitter because sometimes Trumps delete some of his tweets, and this source archives those deleted tweets. Another reason is it takes time to get approval of Twitter developer account.
